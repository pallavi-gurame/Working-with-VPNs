# Working-with-VPNs
Hands-on project demonstrating VPN setup, IP verification, encryption check, and privacy feature analysis.

# Objective
Understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting privacy and securing communication.  
Gain hands-on experience with VPN setup, IP verification, and browsing security checks.

# Tools Used
- VPN Client: ProtonVPN (Free Tier) / Windscribe (Free Tier)  
- Websites for Testing:
  - [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) â€“ IP verification  
  - Any HTTPS website (e.g., [https://google.com](https://google.com)) â€“ Encryption check

# Steps Performed

1. Sign Up for VPN Service
   - Chose ProtonVPN Free Tier and created an account.

2. Download & Install
   - Installed ProtonVPN client on my system and logged in.

3. Connect to VPN
   - Selected a server location (e.g., Japan) and connected.

4. Verify IP Address Change
   - Before VPN connection: Checked IP on whatismyipaddress.com (Original IP).   
   - After VPN connection: Checked IP again (Changed IP).  
    
5. Check Encryption (Padlock Icon)
   - Opened https://google.com and confirmed the ðŸ”’ padlock icon in the browser address bar, showing HTTPS encryption.

6. Disconnect & Compare
   - Disconnected VPN, checked IP and speed differences.  
  

# Observations

  IP Address Change:The VPN successfully masked my real IP and showed a new location.  
  Encryption: HTTPS websites displayed a padlock, confirming encrypted traffic.  
  Speed: Slight reduction in download/upload speeds after enabling VPN.

# Benefits of VPN
- Encrypts internet traffic for secure communication.
- Hides real IP address to protect identity.
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi networks.


# Limitations of VPN
- May reduce browsing and download speeds.
- Requires trust in the VPN providerâ€™s privacy policy.
- Some websites and services may block VPN IP ranges.
- Does not guarantee complete anonymity.


# Conclusion
The VPN successfully encrypted my internet traffic, masked my IP, and secured communication.  
While it slightly reduced speed, it provided enhanced privacy and protection against tracking.
